We\'ll begin with lambda expressions and the Stream API, which bring new fundamental patterns to the Java platform. Many problems solved with the Iterator pattern are now solved much more efficiently with the patterns brought by the Stream API. But Java 8 is not only about lambdas, streams and collectors, there is also a new Java Date and Time API which are covered in this course. This API fixes all the flaws of the previous Date/Calendar API and brings new, very useful, concepts and tools. Many new features that bring a functional programming approach have been added to the Collection API. This is also covered in detail. Many more things are covered; little things, scattered here and there in the JDK, like this new StringJoiner class, useful to join strings with a prefix, a postfix, and a separator. JavaFX and Nashorn are also quickly covered, to show the FXML way to describe Graphical User Interfaces, and the new ways to describe JavaFX in Javascript using Nashorn.",
